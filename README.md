The rest of the codes works well with the recent version of pytorch, torchvision, etc. 

But when it comes to transformer, it needs torchtext, of which the development is stopped. Therefore, in order to run the code for transformes, the following are needed (at least for me):

- Python 3.7.12
- Pytorch 1.7.0
- Torchvision 0.8.1
- Torchtext 0.8.0

(The transformer code needs further improvement.)
